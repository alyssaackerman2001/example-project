            <h2>My Name is jhon and living the simple life saved my life</h2>

            <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate
            any of it because there was too much.</p>
            <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a
            relationship.</p>

            <h3> How I turned things around </h3>
            <p> <strong> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
            sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was
            in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. </p>
            
           <h3> Now I live the simple life </h3>
           <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have
            more free time to enjoy.</p>
            
            <p> With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others
            can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site! </p>
